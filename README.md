**Uber Data Analysis - End-to-End Data Pipeline**

***Introduction***
Welcome to the Uber Data Analysis project! In this project, I'll share my journey and experiences in building an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline for analyzing Uber data in the New York region. This project has been a great learning experience, combining cloud technologies, data engineering, and data analysis. Here, you'll find details, code snippets, and insights into this exciting venture.

***Project Highlights***
****Data Extraction:**** The first step was extracting approximately 1 million Uber data records for analysis. We collected this data from various sources and endpoints.

****Data Model Design:**** We designed an efficient data model to store the extracted data in a structured format optimized for fast query performance. The data model was carefully crafted to enable effective data analysis.

****Data Validation and Quality Checks:**** Python, along with powerful libraries like Pandas and Numpy, played a vital role in ensuring data quality and accuracy. We implemented comprehensive data validation and quality checks to guarantee that the data conformed to our requirements.

****Cloud Transition:**** This project involved transitioning from traditional cloud platforms like AWS and Azure to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The raw data was stored on Google Cloud Storage, setting the stage for the next steps.

****Google Server Deployment:**** We deployed a Google server and installed essential software, including Python. Notably, we incorporated Mage, an orchestration tool, for scheduling and executing the ETL pipeline tasks.

****ETL with Mage:**** The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was implemented in Mage on the Google server. This versatile open-source tool made orchestrating data workflows a smooth and efficient experience.

****Data Transformation:**** The transformed data was loaded into Google BigQuery. BigQuery's advantage is its ability to execute ANSI-SQL queries on the data, providing an in-depth understanding of the data structure and enabling advanced analysis.

****Interactive Dashboards with Looker:**** Leveraging my expertise, we used Looker to create interactive dashboards. These dashboards offer a valuable resource for business owners, supporting informed decision-making with clear data visualizations.

***Takeaways***
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a powerful environment for data engineering projects. Its services, such as cloud storage and Google servers, offer robust support for data processing.
Mage is an invaluable open-source data pipeline tool that adds an element of fun to the ETL process.
Looker's extensive features make it an excellent choice for implementing interactive dashboards.

***Installation Guide***

1.Set Up Google Cloud Platform: Create a GCP account and set up your project. You can find comprehensive instructions on the GCP website.
2. Install Pip on server.
3. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from python.org.
  Libraries required:
  a. Pandas
  b. Numpy
4. Install Mage: Mage is the orchestration tool used in this project. You can install it with the following command:
    pip install mage-ai
5. Start the mage project using command:
    mage start <project_name>

***Conclusion***
This Uber Data Analysis project showcases the exciting journey of building an end-to-end data pipeline for processing, analyzing, and visualizing Uber data. It's an example of harnessing the power of cloud platforms, Python libraries, and orchestration tools to create a valuable resource for data-driven decision-making.
